Welcome to Jackdm.com! This site formerly was the main portal for all of my film and technology projects. My clothing brand, CosmoNaught (name now defunct), was hosted on a separate website. In an effort to streamline all of my projects, Direct Message LLC was created. At [directmessagellc.com](https://directmessagellc.com), there's a showcase for my most recent technology project (under "Labs"), a store for all the clothing I release, and a link to my youtube channel (now titled "Direct Message with Jackdm").

All past posts have been archived to this new site to the best of my ability.

To clarify, Jackdm is simply my first name with my initials. People were always asking if it stood for Direct Message, so I just kind of went with it.

In regards to this particular website, it was created as a fork from [https://github.com/chesterhow/tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale) and modified to fit what I need. If you care about the code check out [https://github.com/Jackdm/jackdm.github.io](https://github.com/Jackdm/jackdm.github.io).

The reason the Direct Message LLC site is hosted on squarespace as opposed to also being on github is for consumer trust. By hosting on squarespace, consumers can know that their money is being handled by a trusted third party.

Thanks for checking out my stuff, hope you like what I make.
