Recently, I finished up a project that had been occupying me on and off for about 2 years. For this time, it was the only hardware project I was working on. Needless to say, it feels pretty great to be finished.

S.A.F.T.D., or Sensory Audio for the Deaf, is a device designed to put a visual representation of audio stimuli within the usersâ€™ field of view, using a single purpose heads up display. If you're interested in reading more about the project, a log of how I made it is located here: [https://hackaday.io/project/166149-sensory-audio-for-the-deaf](https://hackaday.io/project/166149-sensory-audio-for-the-deaf).

If you're interested in looking at the provisional patent application (the first I've ever filed!), click here: [https://hackaday.io/project/166149-sensory-audio-for-the-deaf/log/164862-the-patent-application](https://hackaday.io/project/166149-sensory-audio-for-the-deaf/log/164862-the-patent-application).

Since this is finally (mostly) finished, I should have more time to focus on other projects. Stay tuned for more!
